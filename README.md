## Data Mining the Workplace for Mental Health 
![workcalm](/docs/assets/img/workcalm2.jpg)  
Project aims to inform company practices/offerings that reduce work-interference due to employee mental health using machine learning classification modelings and model interpretation. A decision tree classifier was used to predict work interference and once a model was optimized, feature impact was analyzed using the SHAP library to highlight workplace culture and practices associated with increased or decreased work-interference. Using employee perceptions of culture and company practices, this model was able to predict wether employees experienced work-interference from mental health "never", "rarely", "sometimes", or "often" with 57% accuracy. (Over double what could be guessed by chance).
