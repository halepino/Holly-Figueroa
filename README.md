## Data Mining the Workplace for Mental Health

![workcalm](/docs/assets/img/workcalm2.jpg)

**This project aims to inform company practices/offerings that reduce work-interference due to employee mental health using machine learning classification modelings and model interpretation.**  
  
A decision tree classifier was used to predict work interference and once a model was optimized, feature impact was analyzed using the SHAP library to highlight workplace culture and practices associated with increased or decreased work-interference. Using employee perceptions of culture and company practices, this model was able to predict whether employees experienced work-interference from mental health "never", "rarely", "sometimes", or "often" with 57% accuracy. (Over double what could be guessed by chance).

### Key Findings 
* Work interference from mental health appears minimized by cultures that favor an open-ness of mental health as a recognized issue.
* Feeling safe to discuss mental health with an employer was associated with less work interference.
* Unclear or unavailable mental health resources and difficulty taking time off for mental health was reported with higher work interference.
